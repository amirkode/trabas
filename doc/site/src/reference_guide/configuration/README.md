# Trabas Configuration Documentation
Trabas uses file based `.env` to the config locally inside the binary file location in `trabas_config/`.
This config file shares for both server service and client service if you use the same binary file to run both services.

The configuration can be set using the CLI or by directly editing the `.env` file.

The following section provides a detailed explanation of each configuration:
* [Server](./server.md)
* [Client](./client.md)
* [Common](./common.md)
