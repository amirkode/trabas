# Installation

To use the tool, you can use the all-in-one binary available from the [latest release](https://github.com/amirkode/trabas/releases) or the latest binary generated by the [build action](https://github.com/amirkode/trabas/actions/workflows/ci.yml) for the `main` branch.
Alternatively, you may build the binary file using cargo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/amirkode/trabas.git && cd trabas
cargo build --release --manifest-path cli/Cargo.toml
```
you can find the built binary in `target/release/trabas`.

Ensure to rename binary file name to `trabas` if necessary.

Once you have the binary installed, you must be able to run it from the command line:
```bash
trabas --help
```
This should display the help message for the CLI. You may want to know the usage of the CLI commands. The documentation can be found [here]
